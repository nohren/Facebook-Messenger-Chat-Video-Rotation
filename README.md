# **Facebook Video Chat Rotation**

Allows rotation of your video feed.  Useful if your friend has oriented their phone horizontal when fb messenger expects it vertical.  And now your friend is sideways on your laptop with no way to correct.  No worries just use this script and a button will exist to rotate the feed.

Installation instructions:
1. Install the tamper monkey browser extension.
2. Click Create a new user script and copy/paste the rotation.js file contents into it.
3. Save and enjoy on your next conversation.
